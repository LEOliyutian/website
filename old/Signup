<p>Start logging your ascents and the whole community benefits. Every ascent logged is a micro input into climb statistics, including popularity and route quality. Because ascents are logged against registered climbs, all these micro inputs combine to produce a robust community picture of climbing in an area.</p>

<p>theCrag is the original site for logging ascents, operating since 1999, and is the only site to be logging ascents against a comprehensive list of registered routes. The database has over 170,000 routes, and over 400,000 ascents logged.</p>
